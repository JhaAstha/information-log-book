 Overview


 
The Contact Book Management System is a console-based application developed in C language using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts.
It allows users to efficiently store, search, update, delete, and display contacts using structured data handling.
This project demonstrates practical usage of arrays / linked lists, structures, and basic algorithms for real-world applications.



DSA concept  used:-


structure  -to store details

arrays  - to manage multiple contacts

linkedlist   - contact managment

linear search - for searching any contact

sorting   - to display data in order




sample operation:-

  add contact

  search contact

  delete cobtact

  display contact
